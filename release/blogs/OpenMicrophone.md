## Open microphone support

EBA utilizes Watson speech to text capabilities to provide open microphone support. Users can simply click the microphone icon on the bottom right of the chat input panel to set the microphone into listening mode. Once the microphone is in listening mode, it will automatically transcribe voice input into the chat panel. If EBA detects that the chat input can be answered by the assistant, it will automatically post this question to the system for processing. Otherwise, it will give the user an opportunity to correct its text before submission.
